# SpringBoot2AwsLambda
A SpringBoot application to test [Lambda SnapStart](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/snapstart.html) feature.
This demo application uses **Spring Cloud Function** and [AWS Lambda adapter](https://docs.spring.io/spring-cloud-function/docs/current/reference/html/aws.html#_aws_lambda).
It will run in AWS Lambda **Java 11 (Corretto)**  runtime.
"Lambda SnapStart for Java can improve startup performance for latency-sensitive applications by up to 10x at no extra cost"
Let's verify... :)
